# project description


The objective of this project is to create an image classification Deep learning model to accurately predict the likelihood that an image contains a person wearing a face mask, or not. We will make use of the following dataset, wich contains 1,800+ images of people either wearing masks or not.



Also this project is an evaluation task for Asvanced Deep learning For images in the of Paris-Dauphine university


## project steps & sections:

**First section(Importing necessary packages & environement setup)**

In the first section we will be importing necessary packages and mounting our drive to the dataset path 

**Second section(importing and visualizing data)**

we will importe our dataset from google drive, check houw many image we have as well as how many images ectantion we have. Then we check if we have duplicated images and / or missing/broken images. if it is the case we will remove theise duplications. The second phase is to get our labels and images  into pandas dataframe . Finally plot some images with their classes distribution to know better ur dataset.

**Third section(Data preparation & pre-processing)**

from the first look to the dataset we remark that there is some images that does not have the same size. so we do some visualisation to see the distribution of the hight & width of images shape based on median, quartiles and outliers( images with too hoght resolution)

the second step now is to split dataset into test & train data
and then Encode Labels and Normalize them


**Fourth section(Build a model "from scratch":)**

In this part we create a basic model made of a convolutional bloc. Compile your model (use SGD optimizer and choose a relevant loss and metric). Fit your model. Finally we plot our loss and metrics to evaluate our model.


**Fifth section(Evaluating a model based on transfer learning)**

implement the following modele by transfert lerning 

VGG19

INCEPTION V3

InceptionResNetV2

RESNET50

Xception


**six section(Conclusion & link to github)**

From what we experemented we chose to save our best model weights.
